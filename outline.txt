abstract:
civilization is destroyed after nuclear bombs go off in a typical fallout/nuclear war type situation. you retreat to a bunker to ride out the fallout and eventually others begin to flock to you for safety and guidance through the nuclear winter

 
years pass and you discover as others die around you that the radiation mutated some part of you rendering you immune to biological aging(senescence). as humanity rises up from the ashes of nuclear war, you guide them into the future with your wisdom eventually uniting the planet under your empire and spreading your banner across the stars.

the game is split into stages paying homage other games of the genre. heavy emphasis on the story with frequent anecdotes/journal entries fleshing out the world and the survivor's struggle.

stage 1 - Bunker (crank-esque)
resource: air
trapped in a bunker have to pump the air filter to stay alive. gameplay resembles the game 'crank' and involves spinning a crank around to push air through the filter. occasionally the filter needs-
to be cleaned

stage 2 - Nuclear Winter (a dark room-esque)
resource(s): air, food, water, wood, building supplies, 'space'
after the fallout settles nuclear winter soon sets in. you dig down to expand the shelter as more people arrive and more buildings are needed. air continues to be important but is now operated by primitive wood burning motors
